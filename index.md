# Project : [Spoken Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/manijhariya/SpokenDigitRecognizer)
- Created a tool that can Recognize the English Spoken Digits
- Collected data from [FSDD](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)
- Engineered Sounds to convert those sound files to images using STFT using matplotlib 
- Engineered sound images to convert those sound files to csv/npy in array format
- Approached for simple K-nearest neighbor approach
- Approached for neural network based solution using CNN (Convolutional neural network) in keras
- Approached for neural network based solution using ANN (Artificial neural newtork) in keras
- Build a client facing API using flask

# Project : [Sports Ball Classifier](https://github.com/manijhariya/SportsBallClassifier)
- Created a tool that classify Sports Ball in three different category.
- Scraped over 1000 Images for Sports ball from Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ecosia using two simple python scripts
- Engineered Images to convert those images to data field to store in csv file
- Approached for naive based Logistic Regression using LogisticRegression model (scikit-learn)
- Approached for neural network based solution using CNN (Convolutional neural network) in keras
- Build a client facing API using flask

# Project : [ChatBot](https://github.com/manijhariya/ChatBot)
- A Chatter bot which talk mostly like me
- Collected data from Movie-Dialogue
- Engineered Movie dialogues to covert them into a 2-way human talk like structure
- Engineered preprocessed those Talks into data which can be suitable to fit in model
- Build a Encoder and Decoder using Recurrent Neural Network layers to train model.
- Build a Encoder and Decoder using Recurrent Neural Network layers to use in API tasks
- Build a terminal facing API to make it talk.

# Project : [MISUKernel](https://github.com/manijhariya/MISUKernel)
- A RTOS kernel with many features
- A fully developed kernel specially designed in EK-TM4C123GXL (TI Tiva C series MCU board)with ARM Cortex-M4 processor 
- Developed with IAR workbench in C language

# Project : [Loco-Locator](https://github.com/manijhariya/Loco-Locator)
- A fully developed location sender of device through e-mail..
- Written in BASH script

# Project : [CoderKing](https://github.com/manijhariya/CoderKing)
- A Light weight Text-Editor
- A fully developed light weight text-editor for general purpose..
- Build and Written in GCC-9 C++

# Project : [Hand Written Digit Classifier](https://github.com/manijhariya/HandWrittenDigitClassifier)
- Hand Written Digit Recognition ML project impliment in Tensorflow(Python)
- It uses the Tensorflow framework and MNIST Datasets to overcome the complexity of the ML projects it has
  file upload feature to upload image than it is going to predict about that image.
- Written in Python with Tensorflow , MNIST, flask Packages

# Project : [TalkActives](https://github.com/manijhariya/TalkActives)
- Full Stack Web-User(ChatBot) Messanger
- A Full Stack (FrontEnd and BackEnd) for a fully designed messanger which can work as the popular apps like
  WhatsApp and Instagram the difference is that it is a ChatBot you are not going to talk here to real person but
  significantly you are going to talk with Bot which talks more like a real person..
- Build in HTML , CSS, JavaScript , PHP

# Project : [WebBot](https://github.com/manijhariya/WebBot)
- webscraper for Data Collecting.
- A toolkit of scripts to automate the data collecting work which can again be used in different Machine learning Project and other Projects..
- Build and written in Python
