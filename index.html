	<div id="Aboutme" class="tabcontent">
		<br><br><br>
		I am under graduate student at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science currently
 		in 3rd year of my graduation.<br><br>
 		Constantly working on different field projects in Machine learning and Data Science,
 		Built a ChatBot for general talk, SportsBallClassifier and SpokenDigitRecognizer using
	 	Machine Learning models with Sklearn and Keras. I am enthusiastic about Machine Learning
 		and so much inspired by <b>Alan Turing's</b> work specially about his papers known as <i>"Computing 
 		Machinery and Intelligence (1950)"</i><br><br>
 		I was at internship and training program at ExpertHub Pvt. Ltd. for 1 month. Besides doing
 		ML projects i have done some security tool and development works also as all are listed in
 		Projects tab.<br><br>
 		Besides Machine Learning i am also interested in Microcontrollers especially about Arm
 		based MCUs. I have built a RTOSkernel for a MCU. I think microcontrollers are important part
 		of AI especially when i comes to deployement and productionising ML products. I have also done
 		certification in Deep Learning in Arm for deployement of ML products.<br><br>
 		I am also passionate about Security Research especially about Bug Bounting. I have participated
 		in many "Catch the Flag" events and competitive learner at Hack The Box events. I have also certification
 		in Professional Tool Building in Python through Cybrary. <br><br>
 		I am so keen to work in Office places and contribute with co-workers and developing industries best
 		products with only one belief that <b><i>"Machines Can Think"....</b></i><br><br>

		<b><i>* Work Experience </b></i><br><br>
		<ul><li><h4>Natural Language Processing and Project Architecture Engineer (Training)</lr></h4>
 		ExpertHub Pvt. Ltd.<br>
  		It was a training program for 1 month in Machine Learning. We have a<br>
  		project team a built a Hand Written Digit Recognizier in keras using<br>
  		MNIST dataset. I resposbility was to working on language processing<br>
  		side of the work and explain it to co-workers with my best so they can<br>
  		build a neural network. Besides that i have to help in project architecture<br>
  		also like how API is going to work and look-like and all that...<br>
  		I was really good experience working with and for the co-workers and<br>
  		contribute in project which was a runner up in final competition ... Overall<br>
  		training was all about team work and contribution.</ul>

		<ul><li><h4>Ethical Hacking </h4></li>
  		What After College group
  		It was a small workshop for two days conducted in Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai.<br>
  		In workshop there was lectures about hacking and cyber security using tools like Matasploit,<br>
  		Burp Suite , Nmap and more.... It was fine workshop to kickstart on security features of<br>
  		software development.. <br><br></ul>
