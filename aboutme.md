# About Me
 I am under graduate student at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science currently
 in 3rd year of my graduation.
 Constantly working on different field projects in Machine learning and Data Science,
 Built a ChatBot for general talk, SportsBallClassifier and SpokenDigitRecognizer using
 Machine Learning models with Sklearn and Keras. I am enthusiastic about Machine Learning
 and so much inspired by Alan Turings work specially about his papers known as "Computing 
 Machinery and Intelligence (1950)"
 I was at internship and training program at ExpertHub Pvt. Ltd. for 1 month. Besides doing
 ML projects i have done some security tool and development works also as all are listed in
 Projects tab.
 Besides Machine Learning i am also interested in Microcontrollers especially about Arm
 based MCUs. I have built a RTOSkernel for a MCU. I think microcontrollers are important part
 of AI especially when i comes to deployement and productionising ML products. I have also done
 certification in Deep Learning in Arm for deployement of ML products.
 I am also passionate about Security Research especially about Bug Bounting. I have participated
 in many "Catch the Flag" events and competitive learner at Hack The Box events. I have also certification
 in Professional Tool Building in Python through Cybrary
 I am so keen to work in Office places and contribute with co-workers and developing industries best
 products with only one belief that "Machine Can Think"....
